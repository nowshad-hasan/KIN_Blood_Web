### About
KIN is a voluntary organization of SUST (Shahjalal University of Science & Technology), Bangladesh. One of the major activities of 
this organization is to manage blood instantly for general people. Normally university students donate blood in this fact. To comunicate
between donor and client, KIN has a fixed post called 'Blood Secretary' who manages blood and write the latest donation date of the donor.
The whole process of this system is managed in diary that means offline. So, to make the system automated I made this project where the
secretary can do the whole things online.
### Features
* Upload excel with donors and their blood group
* Add/edit/delete/ modify donor
* Update donation date
* Filter specific donors and quick access
* Disable any donor if not available
* See the remaining days of next donation (normally 120 days) for a particular donor

### Technologies
Technologies I use in this projects are - 
* JSP
* Java Servlet
* Bootstrap
* HTML, CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* MySQL
* Digital Ocean

#### Note
